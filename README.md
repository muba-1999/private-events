this is one of the odin projects ypu can find the project here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events
the task was to create a simple clone a bit like eventbrite so as to help understand how associations wrok
in this project a user with an account can create a new event or attended another users event
ths project was a bit challenge for as i ran into alot of bugs and i had to spend my most of the time googling trying to understand what the error was and what caused but in the end i pushed through and did my best to make the project.
